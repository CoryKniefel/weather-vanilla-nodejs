# About 

This is just a very simple application that uses the free version of OpenWeather to get the weather
for Hood River, OR. 

It's just for practicing with Node.js' HTTP client. It also makes use of Node's new native support for 
.env files. Normally I would use Typescript, but in this case I chose not to simply because there are only two
functions and their return types are obvious.
